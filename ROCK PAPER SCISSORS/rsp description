This Python project code implements a basic rock-paper-scissors game where the user inputs their choice (0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors), and the computer randomly selects its move. ASCII art representations of the choices are displayed, creating a visually appealing interface. The game logic determines the winner based on the combinations of user and computer choices, and the result is printed, indicating whether the user wins, loses, or if it's a draw. The code adds an entertaining touch to the classic game, combining user input, random computer selection, and visual elements to create an engaging and interactive experience.
