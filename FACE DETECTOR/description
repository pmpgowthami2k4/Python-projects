This Python code uses OpenCV, a computer vision library, to perform face detection in an image. It first installs the necessary package, then loads the Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection. The `detect_faces` function takes an image as input, converts it to grayscale, and utilizes the cascade classifier to identify faces. Rectangles are then drawn around the detected faces. The code uses Matplotlib to display the original image with overlaid rectangles around the faces. Users are prompted to upload an image for face detection within the Colab environment, and the program reads and processes the uploaded image, showcasing the detected faces. Note: To run this code in a local environment, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed.
